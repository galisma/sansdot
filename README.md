## 2D and 3D cross-platform game engine

**[Sansdot Engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ka1QZQ4zf0) is a feature-packed, cross-platform
game engine to create 2D and 3D games from a unified interface.** It provides a
comprehensive set of [common tools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ka1QZQ4zf0), so that
users can focus on making games without having to reinvent the wheel. Games can
be exported with one click to a number of platforms, including the major desktop
platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows), mobile platforms (Android, iOS), as well as
Web-based platforms and [consoles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ka1QZQ4zf0).

## Free, open source and community-driven

Godot is completely free and open source under the very permissive [MIT license](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ka1QZQ4zf0).
No strings attached, no royalties, nothing. The users' games are theirs, down
to the last line of engine code. Godot's development is fully independent and
community-driven, empowering users to help shape their engine to match their
expectations. It is supported by the [Godot Foundation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ka1QZQ4zf0)
not-for-profit.

Before being open sourced in [February 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ka1QZQ4zf0),
Godot had been developed by [Juan Linietsky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ka1QZQ4zf0) and
[Ariel Manzur](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ka1QZQ4zf0) (both still maintaining the project)
for several years as an in-house engine, used to publish several work-for-hire
titles.
